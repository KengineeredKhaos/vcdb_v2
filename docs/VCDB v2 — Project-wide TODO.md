# VCDB v2 — Project-wide TODO

Conventions:

- Status: [ ] todo, [~] in-progress, [x] done
- Use **@TODO:** as the queue marker for new work.
- Keep items “atomic” (one outcome per TODO), but allow sub-bullets.
- Prefer links to files/paths and named functions when applicable.

## Foundation Docs

- [ ] @TODO: Generate a **“strip map”** of the **Entity Wizard** flow for future
  devs, showing each step end-to-end:
  - essential form data acquisition per step (what/why)
  - nonce lifecycle: issue → expect → consume (stale-submit behavior)
  - route responsibilities (PRG, redirect targets, commit/rollback)
  - service responsibilities (normalize/validate, DB reads/writes)
  - no-op rules (no write/no flush/no ledger)
  - `db.flush()` boundaries vs `db.commit()` boundaries
  - ledger entry assembly (field names only, request_id/actor/target/op)
  - confirmation UX (created/updated views) and resume behavior
  - include a sequence diagram + per-step checklist

## Customers Slice Canonization

- [ ] @TODO: Replace Customers slice schema with the new facet-key design:
  
  - `customer_customer` (card: intake_step/needs_state/tier mins/watchlist)
  - `customer_eligibility` (PK=FK; veteran/homeless + branch/era + method)
  - `customer_profile` (PK=FK; assessment_version + last_assessed metadata)
  - `customer_profile_rating` (12 rows per assessment_version; default `na`)
  - `customer_history` (append-only; envelope-cached columns + data_json)
  - confirm constraints/enums match canon values (branch/era/method/rating scale)
  - dev DB: prefer dump/rebuild (no migration rabbit hole)

- [ ] @TODO: Canonize the **CustomerHistory “envelope + payload” blob**:
  
  - store schema at:
    - `app/slices/customers/data/schemas/customer_history_blob.schema.json`
  - implement Customers-side validation for envelope (payload opaque)
  - cache envelope fields into `customer_history` columns:
    - `schema_name`, `schema_version`, `title`, `summary`, `severity`
    - `public_tags_csv`, `has_admin_tags`, `admin_tags_csv`
    - `source_slice`, `source_ref_ulid`, `happened_at`
  - keep rule: staff UI never renders `admin_tags` (silent review signals)

- [ ] @TODO: Implement CustomerHistory append entry path (cross-slice write):
  
  - add `customers_v2.append_history_entry(...)` contract (controlled write)
  - Customers service parses JSON blob, validates envelope, columnizes cache
  - store full blob in `data_json` unchanged (or stable-dumped if dict input)
  - idempotency strategy (optional): allow caller-provided `dedupe_key` in envelope

- [ ] @TODO: Add producer-side envelope builder helpers (template) and pin usage:
  
  - ensure `history_blob.py` exists in Logistics + Resources (done per your note)
  - docstring: builder must keep in sync with Customers envelope schema
  - add a minimal “usage recipe” snippet in each slice for future devs

- [ ] @TODO: Rebuild Customers `services.py` around the new models (single file):
  
  - keep sections: facet ensure / eligibility commands / needs commands / history
  - services are “commands” and return DTOs (no request/redirect/ledger)
  - implement no-op detection: no write/no flush/no ledger trigger
  - routes own PRG + nonce + commit/rollback + ledger emits

- [ ] @TODO: Rebuild Customers `mapper.py` DTOs for the new schema:
  
  - define Row projections vs View DTOs (Row = DB→service, View = outward-facing)
  - provide minimal “quick peek” summary DTO (non-PII)
  - include `EnvelopeDTO` + `ParsedHistoryBlobDTO` (already started)

- [ ] @TODO: Rewrite Customers routes to support the intake wizard canon:
  
  - PRG + stale-submit defense with `wiz_nonce`
  - deterministic `wizard_next_step(entity_ulid)` resume logic from DB state
  - steps (lean v1): ensure facet → eligibility → needs tier1/2/3 → review → done
  - POST: validate nonce first; stale = flash + redirect; never mutate on stale
  - commit only in routes; services flush only when needed
  - ledger emits only when created or `changed_fields` non-empty

- [ ] @TODO: Customer Needs Assessment rules (v1) pinned and implemented:
  
  - precreate 12 rating rows as `na` when needs_state flips to `in_progress`
  - `unknown` reserved for “assessed but unknown/declined”
  - tier rollup rule: min(1/2/3) ignoring `unknown/na`, else tier=`unknown`
  - watchlist remains manual escape hatch; compute “effective cues” in DTOs
  - reassessment: archive prior version snapshot JSON into `customer_history`
    (kind=`needs_reassessment`, schema_name=`customers.needs_snapshot`)

---

## Admin Sweep for Silent Review Signals

- [ ] @TODO: Implement Admin sweep job for CustomerHistory admin tags:
  
  - CustomerHistory stores `has_admin_tags` + `admin_tags_csv`
  - Admin job scans new history rows (cursor-based, idempotent)
  - create admin-only alerts/tasks (no PII; ULIDs + reason codes only)
  - avoid duplicates via unique key (history_ulid + reason_code)

- [ ] @TODO: Define minimal Admin alert storage & UI (v1):
  
  - table: `admin_alert` (target_entity_ulid, reason_code, happened_at, status)
  - view: “Review Queue” list; link to entity + history entry
  - optional: bridge into Calendar tasks later

---

## Cross-slice Contract Cleanup

- [ ] @TODO: Clean up `customers_v2` contract:
  - remove DTOs camped inside the contract (DTOs live in mapper)
  - keep contracts minimal: read cues + controlled history append write
  - standardize ContractError wrapping and error codes

## Standard Guard Helpers

- [ ] @TODO: Sweep mutating services for standard guard helpers:
  - add `_ensure_actor_ulid()` alongside `_ensure_entity_ulid()` and
    `_ensure_request_id()`
  - for every **mutating** service command:
    - call all three guards at the top (fail fast)
    - require `request_id` and `actor_ulid` as keyword-only params
  - defer refactors of stable/working slices; apply forward-first
  - later: run a deliberate alignment sweep across older slices (Entity, etc.)

---

## Policy - Customer Needs Reassessment

- [ ] @TODO: Governance policy for time-based Customer needs reassessment.
  
  - define policy intent:
    - reassessment interval(s) (e.g., default_days, tier1_immediate_days, etc.)
    - optional triggers (e.g., watchlist=true, homeless_status=verified)
    - what constitutes “overdue” (based on CustomerProfile.last_assessed_at_iso)
  - decide where the system surfaces the trigger:
    - CustomerDashboard shows “Reassess due” banner (staff-visible)
    - optional silent admin_tags for systemic review (admin-only sweep)
  - implement mechanics (later):
    - service computes `is_reassess_due` (read-only) from governance rules
    - route/UI shows banner and provides “Begin reassessment” action
    - `needs_reassess()` snapshots current version → CustomerHistory blob
      (kind="needs_reassessment") then calls `needs_begin()`
  - ensure no spam:
    - only snapshot on reassessment start, not on every needs_set_block()
